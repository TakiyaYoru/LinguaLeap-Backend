Protein is important for building and repairing our muscles. Good sources of protein include meat, fish, eggs, beans, and nuts. We should include protein in every meal.

Carbohydrates give us energy for daily activities. Whole grains like brown rice, whole wheat bread, and oats are better choices than refined grains. They provide more nutrients and fiber.

We should also drink plenty of water throughout the day. Water helps our bodies function properly and keeps us hydrated. It's better to drink water instead of sugary drinks.

Remember to eat regular meals and avoid skipping breakfast. Eating at regular times helps maintain a healthy metabolism and keeps our energy levels stable.`,
